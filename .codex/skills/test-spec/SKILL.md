  Generate `specs/[feature].test.md` from an approved feature spec. Use when
  Codex should map requirements, examples, and edge cases into traceable
  unit, integration, and end-to-end tests before writing test code.

# Test spec authoring

## Task

Turn an approved feature spec into a concrete, traceable test plan.

## Instructions

1. Read the approved feature spec first.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` for testing conventions and commands.
3. Read the concrete plan file if it contains milestone-specific validation
   commands or boundary notes that affect the tests.
4. Extract every requirement ID, edge case, and example.
5. Create test IDs such as `T1`, `T2`, `T3`.
6. Map each requirement ID to one or more tests.
7. Include the right level of coverage:
   - unit tests for local logic
   - integration tests for boundaries and wiring
   - end-to-end or smoke tests for user-visible flows when needed
8. Use concrete fixtures, inputs, and expected outputs whenever possible.
9. Add explicit exclusions under `What not to test`.
10. Flag vague or untestable requirements instead of pretending they are
    covered.

## Gotchas

- Do not leave a `MUST` requirement uncovered.
- Do not generate tests from an unreviewed or unstable spec.
- Do not skip integration boundaries.
- Do not invent coverage for behavior the spec does not define.

## Expected output

- grouped test cases
- requirement-to-test coverage map
- concrete fixtures or scenarios
- explicit exclusions
- uncovered gaps, if any
